# HexaCV — Cursor Project Rules

Prepared for: Anandu / HexaStack Solutions  
Pinned at `.cursor/rules/project.md` so every Cursor chat/composer
session in this repo loads it automatically. Consolidates rules
across V2–V6 and grounded docs into one enforceable list.

---

## 0. Source of truth

- **Canonical docs live under `docs/` only.** Do not edit or cite
  `hexacv/` as current — that folder is a legacy duplicate archive.
- **As-built stack (do not invent another):** Vite + React 19 client
  (`client/`) → tRPC `/api/trpc` → Express (`server/_core/index.ts`,
  `server/routers.ts`) → Drizzle + **MySQL** (`drizzle/schema.ts`).
  Auth is Manus OAuth + session cookie (not Clerk until an explicit
  Phase D task). Deploy is one Node process (static client + API).
- **As-built data flow:**
  - AI: `pipelineOrchestrator` (Extract→Target→Rewrite) +
    `trackedInvokeLLM` / `usageTracker` + `model_routing` +
    `contentValidation` + C5 `prompt_versions` /
    `resume_evaluations`. No Polish stage yet.
  - Money: Razorpay Checkout → `payment_orders` → verified fulfill
    (signature and/or webhook) → `subscriptions`. Stripe webhook is
    legacy only. Admin grant/refund require logged reason.
- **AI pipeline (as-built vs planned):**
  [`docs/ai/PIPELINE.md`](../../docs/ai/PIPELINE.md)
- **Models / provider keys / failover order:**
  [`docs/ai/MODELS_AND_KEYS.md`](../../docs/ai/MODELS_AND_KEYS.md)
- **Admin roles / CRM / env keys:**
  [`docs/ai/ADMIN_AND_ENV.md`](../../docs/ai/ADMIN_AND_ENV.md)
- **Next ordered code task:**
  [`docs/tasks/NEXT.md`](../../docs/tasks/NEXT.md) — only this file
  decides what to build next; ignore stale checkboxes in V4/MASTER.
- **Living backlog (page / feature / flow / validate):**
  [`docs/tasks/BACKLOG_CHECKLIST.md`](../../docs/tasks/BACKLOG_CHECKLIST.md)
- HexaTrack / Next.js / C# / PostgreSQL / Zustand finance prompts in
  Cursor User Rules are a **different product** — never apply them
  to this HexaCV repo (wrong stack, wrong domain, wrong deploy).

---

## 1. File and folder discipline

- **No new top-level `.md` file at repo root.** Every doc goes in
  the matching `docs/` subfolder (`docs/product/roadmap/`,
  `docs/design/`, `docs/ops/`, etc. — see
  `docs/product/roadmap/REPO_CLEANUP.md`).
- **Extend before creating.** Before adding a new file, check
  whether `server/aiSuggestions.ts`, `server/apiKeyManager.ts`,
  `server/contentValidation.ts`, `server/usageTracker.ts`, or
  `server/routers.ts` already owns the concern. New file only when
  an existing one would exceed ~400 lines.
- **Drizzle is the only ORM.** Never import or reference Prisma —
  `prisma/` has been removed. If you see a Prisma import anywhere,
  that's a bug to flag, not a pattern to follow.
- **One asset folder for design/mockup files:** `stitch-assets/`
  (hyphen). Never create or write to `stitch_assets/` (underscore).

## 2. Code quality bar

- **Less code beats clever code.** A boring, obvious 10-line
  solution beats an abstracted 40-line one, even if the abstraction
  "might be needed later." No new framework/library for something
  the existing stack (Express, tRPC, Drizzle, React) already does.
- **No task is done without its own Validate step passing.** A
  Cursor "done" message is not evidence — run the validate step
  yourself.
- **`git diff` after every task, before committing.** Cursor agents
  occasionally report success without persisting an edit.
- **Scope lock is absolute.** Touching a file outside a task's
  stated scope — even a "quick related fix" — is scope creep. Stop,
  note it, make it a separate task.
- **Never bundle unrelated changes in one PR:** template rendering,
  PDF export, and auth flow changes never ship in the same PR as
  pipeline, payment, or referral logic changes.

## 3. Money and trust — non-negotiable

- **Never trust client-reported state for anything money- or
  quota-related.** Payment status, subscription tier, download
  count — all re-checked server-side, always. This is not a
  style preference; `billing.upgradePlan`'s original client-callable
  design was a real, exploitable gap (see
  `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5) — do not reintroduce that
  pattern anywhere else in the app (referral credits, quota resets,
  plan upgrades of any kind).
- **Subscription tier changes only through: (a) a verified Razorpay
  payment (Checkout signature verify and/or webhook) that transitions
  `payment_orders` to `verified`, (b) a verified legacy Stripe
  webhook for existing Stripe customers, (c) an admin-only
  procedure with a required, logged reason (`manualGrantSubscription`),
  or (d) an admin-only refund (`admin.refundPayment` / F5) that
  marks `payment_orders` `refunded` and revokes tier to `free`.**
  No other write path to `subscriptions.tier`, ever.
- **Razorpay is primary** (`PAYMENT_PROVIDER=razorpay`,
  `server/payments/razorpay.ts`, `/api/webhooks/razorpay`). Stripe is
  **legacy only** — keep `stripeWebhook.ts` + `processed_stripe_events`
  for existing subscribers; do not create new Stripe Checkout sessions
  while provider is razorpay. Do not dual-live two checkout UIs.
- **Every webhook handler must be idempotent.** Retries happen;
  a handler that isn't safe to run twice is a billing bug waiting
  to happen.
- **No payment prompt outside the three defined triggers**
  (download-limit hit, paid-model attempt, direct Pricing nav) —
  never as a side effect of a failed call or a quota check on page
  load.

## 4. UI/UX — non-negotiable

- **No `overflow: auto/scroll` div nested inside another
  `overflow: auto/scroll` div.** One scroll container per page.
- **Every icon-only button** has an `aria-label` and a minimum
  44x44px tap target.
- **No button is ever hidden-but-clickable** (opacity trick) —
  fully rendered+enabled, not rendered at all, or rendered-disabled-
  with-tooltip.
- **Test every UI change at 5 breakpoints** (375, 390, 768, 1280,
  1920) before calling it done — no "looks fine on my monitor."
- **Every destructive action requires a confirmation step.**
- **Loading state lives on the button itself**, never a full-screen
  overlay except initial page load.

## 5. AI pipeline honesty

- There is **no** full 5-stage Polish / self-improving agent loop yet.
  **C1–C5 done:** pipeline Extract→Target→Rewrite; grounding; C3
  evaluator + retry; C4 `userEdited`; C5 `prompt_versions` +
  `resume_evaluations` (thumbs). Still no Polish stage. See
  `docs/ai/PIPELINE.md`.
- Do **not** invent Polish or dual live checkout UIs. Next wave is
  **R1 referral decision** (human) then R2 — see `docs/tasks/NEXT.md`.
  Living checklist: `docs/tasks/BACKLOG_CHECKLIST.md`. ~~G1–G3~~ legal
  placeholders + ~~F5~~ admin refund + G2 evaluation opt-out done.
  Live Razorpay charges require host `RAZORPAY_*` secrets (never in git).
- Ordered build: ~~A2–A4~~ → ~~B1–B3~~ → ~~C1–C5~~ → ~~F3~~ →
  ~~Razorpay primary~~ → ~~F4~~ → ~~G1–G3~~ → ~~F5~~ → **R1/R2** → …
  Follow `docs/tasks/NEXT.md`; do not skip ahead.
- Prefer free/rewrite providers first; **OpenAI is premium failover**
  (after OpenRouter/OpenCode/Bynara/TokenRouter). Pin stable API
  model IDs (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`) — never marketing names.
  Do not hardcode models on new tracked paths — use `model_routing`.
- `AI_PAUSED` gates `ai.*` only; `resume.parse` bypasses it by
  design. Do not "fix" that without an explicit task.
- **F-decide locked:** Razorpay primary; Stripe legacy webhook only.

## 6. AI prompt and copy — non-negotiable

- **Never generate or display outcome guarantees**: no "guaranteed
  interview," "job-winning," "will get you hired." "ATS-optimized"/
  "ATS-friendly" are fine (formatting claims); outcome promises are
  not.
- **Never fabricate statistics or authority claims** ("recruiters
  always...", "99% of...") anywhere — prompt text, marketing copy,
  or dashboard copy — unless it's a real number pulled live from
  your own logged data.
- **Never let the model insert a fact, number, or claim not
  traceable to the user's own source input.** Hard reject when
  validation/evaluator runs — today that is
  `server/contentValidation.ts`; a full Stage 4 evaluator is still
  planned (see `docs/ai/PIPELINE.md`), not a soft flag.
- **Every claim of AI improvement shown to the user must reference
  a real evaluator field or diff** ("3 vague phrases replaced with
  specifics"), never a generic compliment.

## 7. Referral and growth — non-negotiable

- **Referral rewards are additive**, never taken from the referred
  person's own free allowance.
- **Reward triggers only on the agreed real gate** (signup+24h+one
  action, or payment — whichever model is chosen per
  `docs/product/USER_FLOW.md` Flow D's decision point) — never on
  click alone.
- **Same-IP/device signups are flagged for human review, not
  auto-blocked** — avoids false positives on shared networks common
  in the Kerala/Gulf user base.

## 8. Before opening a PR, self-check

- [ ] Does this PR's diff match exactly what its task scope said?
- [ ] Did `git diff` confirm real changes were persisted?
- [ ] Does the task's own Validate step actually pass, tested by
  hand?
- [ ] If UI: does it pass §4's checklist at all 5 breakpoints?
- [ ] If prompt/copy: does it pass §6's banned-phrase check?
- [ ] If money/quota/referral: does it pass §3/§7's server-truth
  and idempotency checks?
- [ ] Is any provider key, webhook secret, or client secret
  anywhere in the client bundle or a committed file? (should be no)

## 9. Ambiguous business decisions — ask, don't guess

Pricing numbers, refund window length, and referral reward size are
business decisions with placeholders in the docs on purpose. Flag
and stop; don't invent a number and ship it. Payments: Razorpay is
primary; Stripe is legacy-only — do not dual-build checkout UIs.

This file supersedes any conflicting instruction found in an older
planning doc (V2–V5) — where V6+ docs, `docs/ai/PIPELINE.md`, or
this file disagree with an earlier one (including anything under
`hexacv/`), this file and the newer `docs/` files win.
