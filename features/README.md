# HexaCV Feature Documentation

This folder is the **complete feature blueprint** for building HexaCV — a grounded,
pay-per-build AI resume builder for Gulf & India job seekers.

Each file documents one feature area: purpose, user flow, implementation (files),
key decisions, and edge cases. Items marked **NEW** were added in the current
development cycle (guest-flow fix, landing redesign, build bundles, extraction
window, contextual editor, floating labels, 44px tap targets).
