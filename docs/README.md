Read this file first. It tells you what every other doc is for and
how to start work in Cursor.

**Also useful:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`ai/PIPELINE.md`](./ai/PIPELINE.md) | **AI stages as-built vs planned + feedback roadmap** |

**The short version:** #1 and #3 you read now. Then follow [`tasks/NEXT.md`](./tasks/NEXT.md) only. Track status in [`tasks/BACKLOG_CHECKLIST.md`](./tasks/BACKLOG_CHECKLIST.md). A–C + Razorpay + F4 are done.

## 2. How to start Cursor Pro

1. Open the repo in Cursor (`HexaCv-main/`).
2. Repo cleanup is done — docs live under `docs/`, `prisma/` is gone,
   stitch assets are under `stitch-assets/` only.
3. Confirm `.cursor/rules/project.md` is active in Cursor settings.
4. Branch for the first real task: `fix/upgrade-plan-lockdown` (P1).
5. Fresh chat: paste only the P1 block from
   [`tasks/TASK_PROMPTS.md`](./tasks/TASK_PROMPTS.md).
6. Continue one block per chat in TASK_PROMPTS order
   (P1 → Phase A → B → F/G → R → I → J/K).
7. Before Phase F: resolve Stripe-vs-Razorpay (`F-decide`) and
   referral model (`R1`) yourself — not Cursor's call.

## 3. First Cursor message (P1 — after cleanup)

```
I'm starting work on HexaCV. Before any feature work, I need one
fix done first — a real security gap, not a hypothetical one.

Context: server/routers.ts has a `billing.upgradePlan` mutation
that calls db.updateSubscription(ctx.user.id, input.tier) directly,
with no Stripe verification. Any logged-in user can currently call
this procedure to grant themselves any subscription tier for free.

Task: change `upgradePlan` so it can only be called by an admin
(reuse the existing `adminProcedure` pattern already used in the
`admin` router namespace), and require an input field `reason:
string` that gets logged. The only other way `subscriptions.tier`
should change is through the existing `server/stripeWebhook.ts`
handler — do not add any other write path to that column.

Scope: server/routers.ts only, plus a console.log of the reason for
now (don't build a full audit-log table in this task).

Validate: confirm a non-admin user calling the old path gets a
permission error, confirm an admin call with a reason succeeds,
confirm the Stripe webhook path is completely untouched and still
works via a test checkout.

Follow the rules in .cursor/rules/project.md for everything else —
scope lock, git diff before committing, no new files unless this
one would exceed ~400 lines.
```

## 4. If you only remember one thing

Fix the `upgradePlan` gap before anything else — payments, referrals,
and growth assume money/tier state only changes through a verified
path.
